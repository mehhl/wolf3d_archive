# Code for Group 2's project in AI Algorithmic Art class @ University of Warsaw

<font color=red>This is a WIP!</font>

This is the code for an art project that will modify [Nicklas Hansen](https://nicklashansen.github.io) et al.'s awesome **Temporal Difference-Model Predictive Control** algorithm for solving `dm_control`'s challenging Dog-Run task. We will be running experiments on the fully developed agent which can be called psychological in nature. 

See the original paper, [Temporal Difference Learning for Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04955) by [Nicklas Hansen](https://nicklashansen.github.io), [Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io)\*, [Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu)\*
