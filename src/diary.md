Okay, so my goal now is to enrich the simulation. I need to modify the dog model so that it collects extra information about the seeker agents, who are generated according to a random distribution around the agent.

So first order of busines would be to find out what is the reward function of the dog. This requires looking into `dm_control`'s files.

Hm. `:s`e
