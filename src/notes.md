The goal today is to use the `.skn` file supplied by Gabriel to generate a new mesh for the dog. To recall: MuJoCo 2.0 added a deformable mesh type `skin` whose observable shape gets recomputed at each render step. This `skin`, which has `.skn` file extension, is in a format specific to MuJoCo, which is poorly documented. Nonetheless, there are some clues on GitHub and elsewhere on how to generate such a skin from more common `.stl` or `.obj` formats.

Now I want to find out where is the particular `Dog` model that `src/train.py` will be using. Then, by swapping the `.skn` file with the one generated by me and running the simulation, I can verify whether generating my `.skn` was successful or not.

The eval loop in `src/train.py` interacts with MuJoCo through an `env`, created in `make_env()`, which comes from `src/env.py`. In turn, `make_env()` creates the environment by calling `dm_control`'s `suite.load()`. So we need to know which MuJoCo `dm_control`, and in particular the version of `dm_control` installed in my `dog` Python venv, uses.
