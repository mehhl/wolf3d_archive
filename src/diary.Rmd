Okay, so my goal now is to enrich the simulation. I need to modify the dog model so that it collects extra information about the seeker agents, who are generated according to a random distribution around the agent.

So first order of business would be to find out what is the reward function of the dog. This requires looking into `dm_control`'s files.

```{python}
@SUITE.add('no_reward_visualization')
def run(time_limit=_DEFAULT_TIME_LIMIT, random=None, environment_kwargs=None):
  """Returns the Run task."""
  move_speed = _RUN_SPEED
  floor_size = move_speed * _DEFAULT_TIME_LIMIT
  physics = Physics.from_xml_string(*get_model_and_assets(floor_size))
  task = Move(move_speed=move_speed, random=random)
  environment_kwargs = environment_kwargs or {}
  return control.Environment(physics, task, time_limit=time_limit,
                             control_timestep=_CONTROL_TIMESTEP,
                             **environment_kwargs)
```

Okay.
